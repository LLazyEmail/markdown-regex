# Secrets Of High-Performing Teams: Part II


## This is our second newsletter in the series of Secrets of Top-Performing DevOps Teams. In the first part, we’ve got to grips with the [DevOps approach](https://hackernoon.com/devops-fundamentals-you-ever-wanted-to-know-zt2m3uh6) and the way it has [amplified the IT workflow](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/workflow).

Here’s a quick reminder and a short introduction for the unaware:

Tech role has germinated from ["help fix my laptop"](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=horror) to "help me become the best." While [many dev teams are trapped firefighting](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/team-productivity), leading teams [align with the business](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/business), [adopt agile principles](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/agile) and automation, and lead the [digital transformation](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/transformation).

What’s in it for [DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/devops), you’d ask? It’s simple: a robust DevOps team facilitates [faster development](https://hackernoon.com/founders-guide-how-to-outsource-software-development-in-2020-y1473yr7) of new products and [easier maintenance](https://hackernoon.com/3-reasons-why-teams-fail-avx3ta7) of existing deployments. 

Read between the lines - agile-based DevOps approach yields an increase in [development productivity](https://hackernoon.com/4-ways-startups-can-use-tech-and-automation-to-be-more-efficient-j3423w51). And with no silver bullet methods for improving IT [efficiency](https://hackernoon.com/if-formula-1-defined-efficiency-675z3yqd), perfecting DevOps might be your best shot. 

Without further ado, let’s dive into our top picks for [DevOps team success](https://hackernoon.com/devops-as-a-service-or-do-you-really-need-a-devops-team-cc4q32wj).


## Hacking Your Way Through to a High-Performing DevOps Team



1. [High-performing](https://hackernoon.com/3-easy-ways-to-improve-performance-of-your-python-code-dw183uzo) teams put business first <!-- this coment and it will be removed  -->

You’d say, a [revenue-first mindset](https://hackernoon.com/five-undervalued-data-points-for-emerging-businesses-5c2w3eun) won’t get you the probity medal. However, it’s not our point. In fact, profitability should be your top of mind not for the sake of money only. 
<!-- this coment and it will be removed  -->

Successful DevOps teams are more likely to tie their tech projects to revenue, mainly because it’s the 1 [metric for their performance](https://hackernoon.com/the-secret-of-growth-how-to-achieve-dollar1m-arr-in-6-months-vi1832mp). As a result, teams that are business aligned tend to prioritize projects with business management and use business and tech scorecards to measure success. Therefore, just a simple shift from an [activity-driven mindset](https://hackernoon.com/data-that-you-need-is-worth-gold-not-data-that-you-already-have-5c60f9345c6b) to a [revenue-first approach](https://hackernoon.com/4-business-lessons-from-the-failure-of-wework-the-47-billion-dollar-tech-company-3ahi3201) can guarantee a positive change in your team productivity and overall result.


    (We’re not implying that you should ditch the [customer-centric action](https://hackernoon.com/24-customer-retention-strategies-eq1y3ym0), don’t compare apples and oranges)

2. They assign end-to-end responsibility

Separating [development](https://hackernoon.com/ownership-and-responsibility-in-software-development-teams-6wr3n17) and [operations](https://hackernoon.com/0-to-90-bn-in-a-decade-uber-takeaways-for-startups-and-roadblocks-ahead-for-uber-b17c3bee2a3f) can present potential issues and pitfalls like [performance problems](https://hackernoon.com/the-surprise-outcome-of-measuring-our-pull-requests-process-4v683tbw) and inconsistent environments. In DevOps, both groups cooperate as a team that's [completely responsible](https://hackernoon.com/take-responsibility-dont-blame-it-on-the-users-hoz3n2u) for a product from beginning to end. 


Unlike the traditional approach or a [low-performing team](https://hackernoon.com/good-ux-manager-bad-ux-manager-33df51f7367c), where each team member is accountable for their own role, the perfect DevOps team [obliterates those silos](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-prioritize-product-requirements-77d139b4a343) and makes an excellent result the focus of the entire crew.


A [developer is no longer just a developer](https://hackernoon.com/highest-paid-software-developer-c66b9f4cc53e) in charge of X lines of code. A tester is no longer accountable for the expected functionality.  A high-performing team wears multiple hats and has got it [ALL covered](https://hackernoon.com/dont-optimize-things-that-dont-work-yet-957j30qv).

** 3. Automation technology is not an option for a [dazzling performance](https://hackernoon.com/my-top-three-priorities-as-a-software-development-manager-cq2x32c1)**

Let’s be honest: the bright minds like working with new and shiny technology. And you need those [bright minds](https://hackernoon.com/software-specifications-define-plan-and-execute-more-effective-projects-p0803tzz) in your team to make it high-performing and guarantee superb results. It's a bit hard to employ and keep these big stars in a company that trusts in a [creaky, legacy toolchain](https://hackernoon.com/devops-principles-culture-vs-tooling-vvac367z) to build a product, right?


Investing in the [DevOps tools](https://hackernoon.com/7-best-devops-security-practices-devsecops-and-its-merits-mr2p3unk) will not only make the team more effective, but it will also make them want to stay. From a practical standpoint, [automation tools](https://hackernoon.com/automating-security-in-devops-top-15-tools-69253w9e) can increase [tech efficiency](https://hackernoon.com/why-devops-is-important-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-6u1i3tul), eliminate errors, and help [deploy apps faster](https://hackernoon.com/the-difference-between-ci-and-cd-in-devops-bc2z3uae). That refers to simplifying the [process of configuring](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-a-devops-strategy-pk153uyb), monitoring, and maintaining the [network infrastructure](https://hackernoon.com/ever-wondered-why-we-use-containers-in-devops-l5113wif).

## Pull it all together

There's no panacea for [successful DevOps team building](https://hackernoon.com/measuring-devops-metrics-a-how-to-guide-ot113ztl), but the process itself is definitely easier than [quantum physics](https://www.hackernoon.com/how-quantum-dots-technology-driving-advancements-in-lcd-and-oled-display-quality-2e163uxg). The majority of our tips and tricks dispensed above are of common-sense variety. In practice, our [secrets](https://hackernoon.com/are-you-telling-the-story-of-your-software-mc133w92) call for good old-fashioned [hard work](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-approach-strategic-planning-when-the-sky-is-falling-oq5k3yer) and a sprinkle of knowledge.

To deliver top-notch results, employees must be well-settled, teams well-structured, and objectives outlined based on [business priorities](https://hackernoon.com/ceos-survey-on-digital-transformation-in-2017-by-gartner-c2d6e842f86c). And it’s not enough to recruit the right people, retention and training are equally important. Overall, it takes a solid mix of all these components to build a team that truly thrives.
